try to find useful small applications for every tutorial. the resulting program has to do something.
some things, like random numbers, can either be thrown in to other tutorials or precede another one that uses them as a short preceding tutorial
chain tutorials to create a 'big' program in the end, i.e. build one tutorial on the previous one

variables and simple types
operators: simple and complex
control structures -> draw xmas tree or something for 'for' loop. maybe dedicate one tutorial for each type of control structure. -> for, while, if, case
arrays
strings
functions
read from console (cin)
pointers
complex types (enum, ...)
variable scope
structs
classes
templates
inheritance
read command line args
random numbers

preprocessor arguments
design patterns (separate tutorial series for this)
data structures (might also be a separate series)
algorithms (separate series)
